## Installation

### Via Plugin Repository

This plugin is available in the community plugin repository:

**Plugin Index URL:** `https://codddarrr.github.io/stashapp-plugins-repo/main/index.yml`

Add this URL to your Stash plugin sources in **Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Available Plugins** to install directly through the Stash UI.

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the plugin folder to your Stash plugins directory:
   ```
   /var/lib/stashapp/config/plugins/floating-scene-player/
   ```

2. Ensure the folder contains:
   - `floating-scene-player.yml` (plugin configuration)
   - `scene-player.js` (plugin code)
   - `README.md` (this file)

3. Restart Stash or reload plugins from **Settings ‚Üí Plugins**

4. Enable the plugin if it's not already enabled

## Usage

1. **Navigate** to any scenes page in Stash
2. **Click** the ‚õ∂ launch button in the bottom-right corner
3. **Click** on any scene thumbnail to start playing
   - When player is hidden: Links work normally
   - When player is visible: Loads video in floating player
4. **Hover** over thumbnails to preview (only works when player is visible)
5. **Drag** the title bar to reposition the player
6. **Resize** by dragging the corner handle
7. **Click** navigation links to explore performers, tags, and studios
8. **Close** the player with the √ó button when done

## Configuration

The plugin offers several customization settings accessible in **Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Floating Scene Player**:

### Use UI Theme Colors
Apply your current Stash UI theme colors to the player (default: **enabled**). When enabled, the player will automatically match your Stash interface theme.

### Enable Hover Autoplay
Auto-play video preview when hovering over thumbnails (default: **disabled**). When enabled, hovering over a scene thumbnail for 500ms will load it in the floating player. Only works when the player is visible.

### Keep Player Open Across Pages
Player stays open when navigating between pages (default: **disabled**). When enabled, the player and its current video persist as you browse different Stash pages, allowing you to watch while performing other tasks like scanning or tagging.

### Custom Button CSS
Apply additional CSS styling to the launch button. The custom CSS is appended to the base button styles.

**Example:**
```css
border-radius: 50%; background-color: #ff0000 !important;
```

### Custom Player CSS
Apply additional CSS styling to the floating player container. The custom CSS is appended to the base player styles.

**Example:**
```css
border: 3px solid #00ff00; box-shadow: 0 0 20px #00ff00;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Verify plugin files are in the correct directory
- Restart Stash and reload plugins from **Settings ‚Üí Plugins**
- Check that plugin is enabled in the plugins list
- Look for `[Floating Scene Player]` messages in the console

### Launch Button Not Appearing
- Make sure you're on a supported page (see Wide Compatibility section)
- List pages like `/performers`, `/tags`, `/images` are intentionally excluded
- Navigate to a specific page like `/scenes` or `/performers/123`

### Thumbnails Not Responding
- When player is hidden, links work normally (navigate to scene page)
- When player is visible, links load video in floating player
- Wait a few seconds for dynamic content to load

### Video Not Playing
- Check that the scene has a valid video file
- Ensure Stash streaming is configured correctly
- Video starts muted for autoplay compatibility
- Check browser console for network errors

### Navigation Links Not Showing
- Links only appear after a video is loaded and starts playing
- Ensure the scene has metadata (performers, tags, studio)
- Check that GraphQL API is accessible at `/graphql`

### Custom CSS Not Applying
- Make sure you've saved the settings in **Settings ‚Üí Plugins**
- Reload the plugin or refresh the page after saving
- Check console for `[Floating Scene Player] Settings loaded:` message
- Use `!important` if Bootstrap styles are overriding your custom CSS

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No dependencies, pure DOM manipulation
- **IIFE Pattern** - Self-contained, no global namespace pollution
- **Event-driven** - Efficient event handling with proper cleanup
- **SPA-aware** - Monitors navigation changes and reinitializes as needed
- **Async/Await** - Modern async patterns for settings fetching

### APIs Used
- **GraphQL** - Fetches scene metadata and plugin settings
- **HTML5 Video** - Native video element with controls
- **MutationObserver** - Detects dynamically added thumbnails
- **Stream API** - Uses `/scene/{id}/stream` endpoint for video playback
- **Fetch API** - For GraphQL requests

### Performance
- **Debounced hover** - 500ms delay prevents unnecessary video loads
- **Dataset flags** - Prevents re-processing of enhanced thumbnails
- **Conditional events** - Hover preview only active when player is visible
- **Lazy loading** - Player created only on supported pages
- **Auto-orientation** - Detects video aspect ratio via `loadedmetadata` event

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, template literals, const/let, async/await)
- CSS Flexbox for layout
- HTML5 video with stream support
- Touch events for mobile support
